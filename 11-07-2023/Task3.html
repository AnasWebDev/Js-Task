    Write a function named calculateSupply that:
    takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
    calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age 100).
    outputs the result to the screen like so:
    "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
    
    Ex: calculateSupply(30, 3);
    => 'You will need 76650 cups of tea to last you until the ripe old age of 100;
    */

    function calculateSupply(age, amount) {
        let yearAmount = amount * 365;
        let maxAge = 100;
        let count = (maxAge - age) * yearAmount;
        let result = `You will need ${count} cups of tea to last you until the ripe old age of ${maxAge}`
        console.log(result);
    }
    calculateSupply(30, 3);
